# StarCart

The idea is that a user create a collection of their favourite star wars related stuff: films, people, planets, vehicles, starships. At the
moment, the default is to fetch films. you can toggle results, but there's no results yet for characters ( or any of the others ), so some
ideas for improvments could be ( getting progressively harder): ======= The idea is that a user can search for star wars related stuff,
films, people, planets, vehicles, starships. At the moment, the default is to fetch films. you can toggle results, but there's no results
yet for characters ( or any of the others ), so some ideas for improvements could be ( getting progressively harder):

## extend current functionality

1 wire up the endpoint to display the results for characters just like the films components work. ( ie copy/paste )

2 we need pagination also for the results - luckily the json provides a next and previous and a total count of items

## favourites UI

    -- there's a faves component but all we can do is add, we can't delete or sort by rating.

3 update the removeFave function <code> /features/faves/favesSlice.reducer.removeFave </code> to find and remove the selected favourite from
the state faves array

4 It's possible to add the same fave twice, extend the existing addFave function to make sure we're not adding the same fave again

5 add a sort filter for favourites by star rating

6 add filters eg type / 1-star 2-star 3-star

## state

7 add a **remove favourites button** which removes that item from the favourites state slice

8 add a **new state** slice for a **shopping cart** with methods to add, remove, edit items

9 add new RTKQuery API end points for `vehicles` and `planets` to services https://swapi.dev/documentation

## performance

11 add basic Typescript support

10 add unit tests to key components

12 refactor for performance and to optimise component rerenders

# TECH STACK / GETTING STARTED

## install vscode git with git bash for windows ( if windows ) / bash

## install nvm and or node to get the latest version of nodejs 'lts' version

```bash
nvm install lts
nvm use 16.14.0
npm install -g npm@8.5.4
```

## fork repo https://github.com/sjingoFOD/starcart

## install the packages and dependencies and start the app

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

\*\*\* sometimes npm can be buggy, if you need to reinstall packages to clear any errors, then try the following command :

```bash
rm -rf node_modules

npm cii
npm start
```

## If for some reason you can’t get the app to spin up then just have a go using ‘ npx create-react-app’ at hitting some of the endpoints, mapping the data and displaying the results as best you can.

# And rather than struggle with something, just email stefan.ingolfsson@fodmobilitygroup.com and I’ll get back to you.
